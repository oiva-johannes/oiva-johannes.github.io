                        I'm numerical cowboy who's interested in a variety of things.
                        I believe that fundamental research progress in science and technology can lead us to a better future when steered correctly.
                        My overall philosophy for life is to get things done and to keep moving forward.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My strengths lie primarily in mathematics and computer science, but I also like to think about economics, finance, statistics, data analysis, societies and societal change.
                        I recently started my second year as a university student majoring in mathematics.
                        I also enjoy cycling, writing, reading hard SF and making great pizzas.
                        There is something weirdly technical and mechanical in the process of making pizza dough and the base.
                        It's like an art and a skill at the same time; it reminds me a lot about programming.

                        <h3>Sunday afternoon</h3>
                        <p class="post-p">
                            In many sunday afternoons when I'm relaxed and peaceful at home, my thoughts flow freely and I need to validate some of those ideas pushing through.
                            Maybe the silence and the peacefulness of the afternoon sunbeams shining through my window causes this, but I'm not sure.
                            In these moments I've started to notice having conversations with Claude 3.5 when wanting to validate someone of those ideas (and fast).
                            For those that don't know, Claude is large language model (LLM) developed by Anthropic.
                            At first (and still) it felt like a slippery slope to do this because current LLMs, like Claude, are far from perfect.
                            They make mistakes and give shallow answers on a regular basis. 
                            This makes sense since LLMs are literally the generalization of their underlying distribution (that they have been trained on).
                            But in the end does any of that even matter?
                            In some ways those things also apply to humans; as humans also make mistakes and are the generalization of their surrounding environment on which they grew up.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Positive reinforcement</h3>
                        <p class="post-p">
                            Im my mind the objections against LLMs don't matter as long as the conversations are fruitful and help me to grow and reinforce my ideas.
                            At first I was sceptical of this, but I've really noticed that some of the conversations I've had have been excellent for exploring my ideas and for improving my thinking on the subject.
                            Obviously the most important thing in these conversations is that I get feedback for my ideas. 
                            But the quality of the feedback is also important.
                            The feedback needs to be thought provoking; so that it seeds new subideas from the original idea.
                            And then you can talk about these new subideas and do the cycle again and again; making it a positive reinforcement loop for new different ideas.
                            And having those different ideas interconnect to each other and understand the connections they share.
                            These are some of the important aspects for fruitful conversations.
                            But the most important aspect of the feedback is the objectivity.
                            You want the model to pushback on your ideas and suggestions. 
                            You want the model to as objective as possible while still positively reinforcing and motivating you to explore your ideas.
                            Because you don't want to have a conversation with a yes-man.
                            A yes-man never truly engages or provokes you.
                            A yes-man will only tell you what you want to hear; and that never brings anything new to the table.
                            So some type of middle ground between reinforcement and pushback would be the perfect feedback to get.
                            But as I said before, these models aren't perfect so the reality can be quite different at times.
                            Still these models have come far enough so the utility in some capacity is there.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Pick the right use case</h3>
                        <p class="post-p">
                            Important part of the skill of using LLMs is to be able to know when they can be useful and when they can't.
                            So when using LLMs you have to understand the right and wrong use cases for them.
                            My advice based on empirical evidence is this: no domain spesific conversations or questions, because that is often where LLM crumbles the worst.
                            So for example, trying to discuss math on detailed level is bad idea and probably wastes more of your time then you just reading the actual textbook (textbooks are important!).
                            More overarching, general and diverse conversations are better suited to be had with an LLM; especially those that contain semantics.
                            So talk about big picture ideas and concepts!
                            NOT implementation details or spesifications.
                            In some ways LLMs are the idea machines of our time. 
                            And our job is to validate which of those ideas are actually good and which can be realistically implemented.
                            Watch this REALLY GOOD machine learning street talk episode related to this notion:

                            Liian monelta ihmiseltä jää elämänsä aikana mahdollisuuksia käyttämättä ja tavoitteita saavuttamatta.
                            Monesti syynä on epävarmuus, joka kumpuaa sosiaalisesta paineesta.
                            On helppo miettiä liikaa yleistä mielipidettä tai sosiaalisia normeja.
                            Joukkoon on helppo sopeutua ja virran mukana on rento kulkeutua.
                            Virran matkassa saattaa kuitenkin jäädä paljon kokematta ja siksi konformisuutta kannattaa välillä välttää, mutta miten?

                            Ja uskomalla itseensä ja tietämällä oman toiminnan johtovan tietoisiin tavoitteisiin, vaikka ulkomaailma olisikin epäluuloinen.
                            Kyseessä on kuitenkin haastava taito, joka vaatii itsenäisen ajattelun ja ymmärtämisen yhdistämistä.
                            Tämä vaatii paljon harjoittelua; eli pitkäjänteistä jatkuvaa uuden oppimista ja ympäroivän maailman havainnointia.

                            Virran mukana kulkeutumisessa on piilohinta, jota monesti ei tule ajatelleeksi. Siksi onkin hyvä miettiä mitä riskin ottaminen todella tarkoittaa? 
                            Monesti ajatellaan, että joukkoon sopeutuminen on riskitöntä.
                            Näin ei kuitenkaan ole, sillä omien tavoitteiden saavuttamisen näkökulmasta joukkoon sopeutumisessa saattaa piileä suuri riski.
                            Se että valitsee helpon, turvallisen tai yleisen tien elämässä voi olla haitallista, vahingollista tai jopa kuolettavaa joillekin tavoitteille.
                            Tässä on edelliseen pointtiin liittyvä hyvä pätkä Sam Altmanin <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/advice-for-ambitious-19-year-olds">blogista</a>:
                            <blockquote cite="https://blog.samaltman.com/advice-for-ambitious-19-year-olds">
                                “In making this decision, you want to take the right kind of risk.
                                Most people think about risk the wrong way—for example, staying in college seems like a non-risky path.
                                However, getting nothing done for four of your most productive years is actually pretty risky.
                                Starting a company that you're in love with is the right kind of risk.
                                Becoming employee number 50 at a company that still has a good chance of failure is the wrong kind of risk.
                                If you stay in college, make sure you learn something worthwhile and work on interesting projects—college is probably the best place to meet people to work with.
                                If you're really worried you'll miss some critical social experience by dropping out of college, you should probably stay.”

                            Kirjoitukseni yhteenveto on, että luottamus itseensä ja jonkin tason oma maailmankatsomuksellinen määrätietoisuus ovat välttämättömiä tiettyjen tavoitteiden tai kauempien unelmien saavuttamisessa. 
                            Ja on tärkeää muistaa, että unelmat toteutuvat vain harvoin vaikka asennoituminen ja suunnitelmat olisivatkin kunnossa.
                            Mutta unelmien kanssa edes puolitiehen pääseminen on paljon tyydyttävämpää kuin kokonaan yrittämättä jättäminen.

                        <p class="post-p">
                            Even though Estonia is a small country with only a population of 1.3 million residents and a GDP of $31 Billion (7 times less than the net worth of Elon Musk), it has gained a foothold in the world of technology.
                            It seems that as a country, Estonia has realized the importance of the digital revolution and infrastructure.
                            Estonian politicians and leaders are on the map when it comes to decisions regarding the future growth and prosperity of their nation.
                            They understand that for Estonia to stay relevant in the future, it has to innovate the old.
                            One of the best examples of this is the Estonian voting system.
                            Estonia was the first country in the world to use internet/online voting (i-voting) for its elections.
                            In this post, I will tell you about the innovative thinking and actions happening in Estonia.

                        <h3>Internet voting</h3>
                        <p class="post-p">
                            In several Estonian elections, it has been possible to vote over the internet since 2005.
                            In 2009 Estonia held its European Parliament election.
                            During this election <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting_in_Estonia#History">14.7%</a> of voters gave their vote over the internet.
                            Exactly 10 years later, in 2019, the same election was held once again, but this time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting_in_Estonia#History">46.7%</a> of all participants voted over the internet.
                            That's almost half of the voters.
                            Comparing 2009 and 2019, we can see a substantial increase in internet voters in a relatively short period of time.
                            Evidently, many Estonian citizens are in favor of this change.
                            This comes back to the attitude and mindset of an Estonian: radical change and groundbreaking innovation are welcomed.
                            Progressive political decision-making has made all of this possible.
                            Estonian leaders and politicians enabled this innovative leap, rather than just making bothersome bureaucratic rules.
                            To this day no significant exploit or bug has been suffered during elections.
                            If a major problem arises in the future it could endanger the elections, and that would be a disaster for democracy.
                            That's why the security and design of this voting system is so important.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Underlying technology</h3>
                        <p class="post-p">
                            This voting system uses Estonian public key infrastructure, which enables secure digital authentication and signing by using public/private key pair encryption/decryption (also known as asymmetric cryptography).
                            The cryptographic verification is used in conjunction with the voter's electronic identity <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/state-information-system/electronic-identity-eid-and-trust-services/electronic-identity-eid">(eID)</a>.
                            The serverside code of this voting system is open source <a href="https://github.com/valimised/ivxv">(GitHub)</a>.
                            The votes are counted only after all personal data have been separated from the votes.
                            Anonymity and trust are the core concepts of modern voting, so it's important that the technology used can fulfill these essentials.
                            It's possible that blockchain technology can be used in securing votes in the future (although this still is highly debated and controversial topic).

                        <h3>Seattle</h3>
                        <p class="post-p">
                            Estonia isn't alone.
                            In February 2020, a district election in the Seattle area became the first for U.S elections to allow each of its 1.2 million eligible voters to cast a ballot through their <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/22/798126153/exclusive-seattle-area-voters-to-vote-by-smartphone-in-1st-for-u-s-elections">smartphones</a>.
                            And 94.3% of the ballots returned were completed electronically.
                            Compared to the previous election, the overall voter turnout nearly doubled in size for this election.
                            These are quite promising results.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Benefits outweigh the risks? </h3>
                        <p class="post-p">
                        Estonia has also received criticism for its innovative nature.
                        Estonian i-voting has definitely seem successful.
                        However, security researchers outside of Estonia <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/news/1202-full.html">[1]</a> <a href="https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/ivoting-ccs14.pdf">[2]</a> have found out some vulnerabilities in the voting system.
                        There is also an excellent video by Tom Scott: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkH2r-sNjQs">“Why Electronic Voting Is Still A Bad Idea“</a>.
                        But Estonian officials <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5OvGTf4AV0">think</a> that the benefits of this voting system outweigh the risks involved: “Risks have to be managed well, but again they can be managed,” says Siim Sikkut who is the chief information officer for the government of Estonia.
                        I-voting is very cost-efficient compared to paper ballot voting because paper ballots require an army of people to count the votes so it's much more time-consuming.
                        In i-voting there is a lot less personnel and workforce involved and needed.
                        Meaning not so many salaries and work hours have to be wasted, essentially saving money and time.
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5OvGTf4AV0">According</a> to the Estonian government, internet voting saves over 11 000 working days per election, which otherwise had to have been taken off.
                        2018 study by Tallinn University of Technology found that i-voting is 50% cheaper than traditional paper voting.
                        With i-voting Estonian citizens can vote wherever they are, even during work shifts or from overseas.
                        Citizens who couldn't vote easily before, like terminally ill and physically disabled people, can now vote with ease.
                        Voters don't have to lose time going to voting locations and waiting in line.
                        Internet voting makes voting simple, convenient, and fast, meaning that no one has to take time off to vote.
                        I-voting is especially useful in getting young people more involved in politics. For these reasons, voter turnout hasn't decreased in Estonia, as it has in many other countries during this decade.

                        <h3>Cost of innovation</h3>
                        <p class="post-p">
                            When creating and developing something new that is considered “world's first”, there are bound to be some problems and risks, but we should learn from encountering them to better our systems.
                            Sometimes things will go wrong, but those are learning opportunities. Being scared never gets us anywhere.
                            The point is that we should study our mistakes and to keep improving the system, making it more profound every step of the way.
                            This is how the best and most innovative technologies are “invented”.

                        <p class="post-p">
                            You will have a great stay in Estonia if you are interested in entrepreneurship and/or tech.
                            Estonia is a remarkably tech-savvy place.
                            It has a new enthusiastic and growing tech startup scene, especially in Tallinn.
                            The business and entrepreneurship opportunities are great because Estonian tax rates are low and legislation isn't overly bureaucratic.
                            Also, Estonia allows an easy nomad lifestyle for foreigners.
                            Estonian digital nomad <a href="https://www.e-resident.gov.ee/nomadvisa/">visa</a> makes it effortless to work and live there.
                            Estonia is one of the fastest innovators in Europe [<a href="https://emerging-europe.com/news/estonia-tops-new-innovation-ranking/">3</a> - 2019] [<a href="https://www.hm.ee/en/news/estonia-one-fastest-innovators-europe">4</a> - 2021] and the Estonian government is a passionate supporter of new tech, innovation, and digitalization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Estonia">[5]</a> <a href="https://estonia.ee/tag/innovation/">[6]</a> [<a href="https://investinestonia.com/smart-industry-chooses-estonia-ericssons-innovation-hub-is-changing-the-world/">7</a> - 2022].
                            It's a fit place for the sovereign individual.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p class="post-p">
                            In the grand scheme of things, Estonia is currently insignificant country as it doesn't really affect the world economy in a major way.
                            But I think that larger countries and their leaders should learn from the mindset of Estonia.
                            There are many hard problems concerning internet voting and implementing it on a larger scale is exceptionally difficult, but
                            I still think that in 20 years i-voting will be a worldwide phenomenon and Estonia will be seen as the catalyst of this transformation.
