    <h3>How languages are taught in Finland</h3>
    <p class="post-p">
        My journey with the English language has been mostly fun and stimulating, but it also has had an unpleasant side.
        I think that most Finns, who enjoy English, have had somewhat similar experience to mine.
        And that is the divide between classroom and outside of the classroom learning.
        The cold hard truth is that only around 5 percent of my English ability was learned in the classroom.
        The rest was learned outside of it. 
        For as long as I can remember the English classes were intellectual torment in many ways.
        The topics were extremely boring and dry.
        The exercises were badly designed.
        The vocabularies were badly chosen.
        And in high school (during covid) the teachers didn't care much about teaching or the language itself.
        Here is approximately how the English experience in a classroom went every time:
        We go to class, teacher introduces new chapter on some absurd theme (international airport for example), then she goes through the dry and unoriginal story about the airport (from the book), after which she tells us that our homework for the next time is to learn the airport vocabulary of the chapter and there will be word test on them.
        Then at home you're not motivated at all to learn some random words related to a terrible story and trivial/insignificant topic.
        But still because the topic vocabulary itself was quite easy you'd score 16/20 on the test.
        In reality you knew these 16 words beforehand and close to zero actual learning was done.
        This whole process is looped for 9 or 10 years (to the end of high school).
        The exceptions (best parts) were the times when we got assigned to read a book, but these were rare and usually the selection was small.

    <h3>But how did I learn english then?</h3>
    <p class="post-p">
        Basically everything from internet and video games (like most of my peers).
        And also later from books and media/news. 
        I can still remember my younger self hovering through the items in my Runescape inventory and trying to understand what their English written labels meant.
        In a way these item names were also arbitrary, but there was a clear distinction, because there was a point in what I was doing.
        I was trying to understand the item names, because it was important for my progression in the game; I had to understand the names so that I could understand what the items did to complete my quest.
        There was tangible incentive and purpose for learning and that's why the learning didn't feel like a trivial exercise like it felt in the classroom.
        I truly think that learning through a meaningful way like this is the best way to do it.

    <h3>What lacks?</h3>
    <p class="post-p">
        But I guess there are some things that only the classroom could teach me. 
        I vividly remember two things that were taught to us: 1. never use “And” or “But” as starter for sentence and 2. never ask and answer a question in your text.
        Even so, I still like to do both of these things in my writing and will never stop that.
        I guess in a way I'm a bad writer of formal/classroom English.
        At least if you were to ask that from my old teachers.
        All in all: English is an amazingly expressive language, but the way it's taught in the classroom needs a major reform.
        My language (learning) philosophy is to have fun while using a language and to not follow every made-up norm to a tee!
